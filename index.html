                about me
                <p>As a second-generation American, I always thought I would end up in the medical or health field. It was not something I necessarily enjoyed or had a passion for, but believed that was the path that I should take. I really enjoyed problem-solving and seeing the results, but I hadn't known how to make a career out of that, so I continued my education in Public Health Sciences. That continued until I stumbled upon my first Javascript class and sparks flew. That was how I found everything I was looking for without even looking for anything. After that, I couldn't get enough. Software engineering calls to all my passions: problem-solving, my love for technology, and the ability to be creative. I loved being presented with a problem and working out how it could be solved, narrowing it down to the most efficient and effective method, and then seeing the fruits of my labor in real time. The work was gratifying and pushed me to keep wanting more. My forte is learning new skills and languages quickly, problem-solving, and an openness to explore. 
                </p>
